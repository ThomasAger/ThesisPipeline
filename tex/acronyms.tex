\subsection{Definitions}

\textbf{Domain} Where the data was originally sourced from $DOM^IMDB$, e.g. IMDB movie reviews.

\textbf{Word} A string of alphanumeric characters that originated from text in the domain $DOM_w$, e.g. the $w = "Horror"$ from a domain of IMDB movie reviews $DOM^IMDB$.

\textbf{Documents} A unique group of words, e.g. a review from a domain of IMDB movie reviews $DOM_IMDB$.

\textbf{Vector Space} A representation composed of vectors.

\textbf{Semantic Space} A representation where spatial relationships between vectors correspond to semantic relationships.


\textbf{Word frequency} The frequency of a word $wf$ for its document $D_wf$.


\textbf{Bag-Of-Words} a BOW of documents $BOW_D$ where each document is composed of unordered frequencies of words $D = [wf_1, ..., wf_n]$. and Conceptual Space we obtain a representation of entities composed of properties. Then, we cover the additional methods we propose to improve this process.


\textbf{Feature} A feature is a distinct useful aspect of the domain, corresponding to a numerical value. 

\textbf{Direction vector} The orthogonal direction to a hyper plane that separates a term in a vector space. 

\textbf{Cluster label} A cluster of words that describe a property.

\textbf{Cluster direction} The averaged directions of all words in the label.
% What does a vector space have that other representations do not?

\textbf{Feature direction} A distinct direction in the space that corresponds to a useful feature in the domain.

\textbf{Feature rankings} The rankings induced from a feature vector.

\chapter{Converting Vector Spaces into Interpretable Representations}\label{Chapter3}


\section{Introduction}\label{chapter3:Introduction}
%What is the importance of similarit
The ever more pervasive digital infrastructure that supports our lives has resulted in many opportunities to obtain data and models to make sense of that data. Semantic Spaces that encode semantic relationships between documents spatially have recently achieved strong results on tasks like X, Y, Z. These neural-network learned representations make use of a variety of new information like grammatical structure, word-context and even image data. Further, as domains become more entrenched in the digital world, the need for models in safety critical domains like medicine or legal domains like credit evaluation have increased the need for producing interpretable models, as well as interpretable representations. However, the dimensions of a semantic space do not correspond to human understandable features, and standard approaches to interpretable text representations do not match the performance of these methods. Ideally, we would obtain a representation that makes use of the rich semantic relationships from a high-performing semantic space, but also has dimensions corresponding to interpretable features. To this end, we aim to introduce in this chapter a methodology to linearly transform a semantic space using just its associated bag-of-words as input into an interpretable representation, and demonstrate the applicability of this interpretable representation to simple interpretable classifiers. 

There are many types of semantic relationships in a semantic space. For our work, the representation is composed of rankings of documents on semantic directions in the space, in particular where those directions correspond to features. We show an example of the kind-of directions we use to obtain our representation in \ref{ch3:ToyDirectionsGraphic}. Directions from domain-specific semantic spaces have been used previously in a variety of ways, For instance,  \cite{gupta2015distributional} found that features of countries, such as their GDP, fertility rate or even level of CO$_2$ emissions, can be predicted from word embeddings using a linear regression model. Similarly, in \cite{kim2013deriving} directions in word embeddings were found that correspond to adjectival scales (e.g.\ bad $<$ okay $<$ good $<$ excellent) while \cite{DBLP:conf/acl/RotheS16} found directions indicating lexical features such as the frequency of occurrence and polarity of words.

%What methods are there for interpretable document classification:

Derrac \cite{Derrac2015} introduced an unsupervised method to go from a semantic space and its associated bag-of-words to a representation where each dimension is a ranking of documents on a feature of the domain. For example, in the domain of movie reviews genres would be a feature, and the dimension would have a numeric value for each document corresponding to the degree it is a particular genre. The contribution of this Chapter is an analysis and experimentation on the quality of these features applied to document classification. The main insight from our work is that these interpretable features do not suffer a performance drop in a non-linear classifier compared to the original representation, and can outperform the original representation and a baseline interpretable representation in a linear classifier. In addition, we find that if a dimension ranks documents on a feature relevant to the task, it can be competitive with more complex models using a single decision tree node. We show an example of the representation from a domain of IMDB movie reviews in \ref{ch3:TreeAndRep}.

%\subsection{Using a Property Representation in a Linear Classifier}


%Our method can use any vector space that linearly separates entities, and so it has potential longevity. This means that our method is relying on structure in the space that does not directly correspond to our desired representation -  we can view our approach as a linear transformation of the space. We address this problem in Chapter \ref{chapter:finetuning}. However, we have the capability to leverage many different methods to construct a vector space for our representation, so as long as dense representations of entities exist it will be possible to use our method, and as they are improved the results that our method can achieve will be improved too. This kind of flexibility also gives us the potential to combine the resultant representations from different vector spaces for classification, e.g. concatenating the vectors from different spaces.

%Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) represent documents as multinomial distributions over latent topics, where each of these topics corresponds to a multinomial distribution over words \cite{Blei2003}. These topics tend to correspond to semantically meaningful concepts, hence topic models tend to be rather interpretable \cite{Chang2009}. To characterize the semantic concepts associated with the learned topics, topics are typically labelled with the most probable words according to the corresponding distribution.

 %What is a direction




%Finally, \cite{derracAIJ} found salient properties as direction vectors in a semantic space of entities (e.g. Movies in a domain of IMDB movie reviews), and labelled them with clusters of words (e.g. $p_1 = {Scary, Horror, Gore}, p_2 = {Funny, Laughter, Hilarious}$).  We show a toy example in Figure \ref{ToyDirection}. %Copied from CONLL 




%%What is our contribution towards those disadvantages in this chapter?
 %"Decision Trees, Decision Tables and Textual descriptions of rules are logically equivalent in the sense that one type of representation can be automatically translated to another (albeit in a simpler or more complex form), while preserving the predictive behaviour of the original model"
% has many positive effects for its users, like lower response times \cite{Narayanan2018, Huysmans2011}, better question answering and confidence for logical problem questions \cite{Huysmans2011} and higher satisfaction \cite{Narayanan2018}.


%%What are some real world scenarios that you could see our work taking effect in?
%In a case study by  \cite{Veale2017}, giving the business users the option between a model with higher classification score but more input variables and a lower classification score but less input variables resulted in more buy-in for system designers. By accurately representing salient concepts in the domain, we are also able to offer a similar option; less nodes in the decision tree in exchange for more accuracy. % Potentially this citation sucks

%As our work performs well even at lower-depth trees, this gives potential users more flexibility in how they want to present the information, e.g. to a potential client. Compared to bag-of-words, which loses its representation capabilities the lower the depth.

This chapter continues as follows: We begin by describing related work, then explain the method, making explicit the variations we have introduced for our experimental work. We follow this with the results of our experiments accompanied by qualitative examples and explanations, and finish with a conclusion on the  benefits and limitations of this approach.

%Our method uses the relationships inherent in a semantic space.

These relationships have been expanded on, for example \cite{TomasMikolovWen-tauYih2013} found that "equivalent relations tended to correspond to parallel vector differences" \cite{Mitchell2015}, and \cite{Mitchell2015}, found that by decomposing representations into orthogonal semantic and syntactic subspaces they were able to produce substantial improvements on various tasks. Additionally, they have also been found to hold inherent gender bias  \cite{Garg2017} as word distances between gendered words (e.g. male, female, she, her) and occupational words e.g. (nurse, programmer) were correlated to the percentage of occupation that gender had for that role in different time periods. %Copy pasted from this

%\subsection{Interpretable Representations}


%There are two ways in which topic models can be used for document classification. First, a supervised topic model can be used, in which the underlying graphical model is explicitly extended with a variable that represents the class label \cite{Blei2010}. Second, the parameters of the multinomial distribution corresponding to a given document can be used as a feature vector for a standard classifier, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Decision Tree. LDA has been extended by many approaches, e.g.\ aiming to avoid the need to manually specify the number of topics \cite{teh2005sharing}, modelling correlations between topics \cite{Blei2006}, or by incorporating meta-data such as authors \cite{rosen2004author} or time stamps \cite{wang2006topics}.


%Broadly speaking, in the context of document classification, the main advantage of topic models is that their topics tend to be easily interpretable, while vector space models tend to be more flexible in the kind of meta-data that can be exploited. The approach we propose in this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds, by providing a way to derive interpretable representations from vector space models.

% One of the more popular models for text representation that labels features in a similar way to our method are Topic Models.

This section details the methodology to go from a Bag-Of-Words (BOW) \ref{background:BOW} and Semantic Space \ref{bg:SemanticSpaces}, to rankings of documents on features of the domain, e.g. In a domain of IMDB movie reviews, where a document is composed of all of its reviews, a movie would be ranked on features like ${Scary, Horror, Bloody}$ and ${Romantic, Love, Cute}$, ideally with as many rankings as salient features of the domain. 
%Make sure features ae explained well earlier 

%\subsection{The Structure of a Semantic Space}

%Salient features of the domain are encoded in the structure of a semantic space. 
% What are directions? How are they encoded? Why are they encoded that way?



 %Features that are important will be spatially organized in a way that reflects the similarity between the bag-of-words representations they were composed of. In particular, we expect that documents will be arranged in a direction, where generally the higher the PPMI score for a group of words that correspond to a feature (e.g. $Horror, Scary, Gore$) the further away they will be from those that have low PPMI scores for those words. We give examples of this in Figure \ref{ch3:DirectionsGraphic}, by projecting documents into a 2D space of salient features we are able to show that these documents are structured according to directions for these features. Salient features will typically be a more abstract representation which will be natural in the domain, e.g. in a domain of IMDB movie reviews, genres.

%The method to obtain interpretable feature-vectors is an extension of the work by \cite{derracAIJ}. This previous work showed how to, filter out words, cluster words to get features, and obtain rankings of documents on those features. In this section, we further analyse and extend this work, in particular by testing a variety of additional filtering methods and clustering methods, and demonstrating how these feature-vectors can produce simple linear interpretable classifiers. 
%To begin, we filter out terms that will not be well represented in the space, and in-turn will not result in good feature rankings. We do so by first removing all terms below a frequency threshold. Then, for each word we obtain a direction in the space that can induce a ranking of documents on that word, and evaluate how well represented that word is in the space and remove those below a threshold. We can consider the terms remaining to be candidate feature-directions, as they are all well represented in the space and are unlikely to be highly scored as representative due to being infrequent. However, it is possible that they may not represent different information from each other, e.g. "blood" and "bloody" are likely quite similar. Additionally, we can understand that a good feature will not correspond directly to a term, but instead to a more abstract concept, e.g. "Blood, Gore, Horror". To obtain these more abstract feature-directions, and ensure the feature-directions are distinct rather than representing the same information, we cluster together similar feature-directions and obtain their feature-rankings to obtain our final representation. Each of these feature-rankings can be labelled with the cluster of words they are composed of. 



\subsection{Obtaining Directions and Rankings From Words}

In this section we show how to obtain directions for words, and explain how to obtain document representations by ranking documents on these directions. For this step, we do not expect all words to be features of the domain.  In the next sections, we aim to filter these words to obtain salient features.

\noindent \textbf{Obtaining directions for each word} For each word $w$, a Support Vector Machine (See Section \ref{bg:SVM}) classifier is trained on the binary Bag-Of-Words representation of that word, where words are labelled as positive if they occurred more than once $w_f >= 1$ and negative otherwise. Although the separation of documents is binary, we can expect that the degree to which they are classified as the word varies. For example in a space constructed from frequency vectors, we can expect that the documents which contain the word more frequently would be further away from the hyper-plane in the positive direction. Following this, we can consider the vector $v_w$ perpendicular to the hyperplane as the direction that models documents from least relevant at the distance furthest from the hyperplane on the negative side to most relevant for the word $w$ at the distance furthest from the hyperplane at the positive side. We show an example of this in the toy domain in Figure \ref{ch3:ToyHyperPlane}. %Although these directions do formally correspond to vectors, we refer to them as directions to emphasize their intended ordinal meaning: feature directions are aimed at ranking entities rather than e.g.\ measuring degrees of similarity. %Graphical representation of

	\caption{An example of a hyper-plane and its orthogonal direction in a toy domain of shapes. Green shapes are positive examples and red shapes are negative examples, but despite the problem being binary those closest to the hyper-plane are less defined than those further away, resulting in the orthogonal vector being a direction.}\label{ch3:ToyHyperPlane}
\end{figure}




\noindent \textbf{Ranking documents on directions} Once we have obtained a direction vector for each word $v_w$ the next step is to quantify the degree to which each document has that word, by obtaining a value that corresponds to how far-up it is on the direction vector. These are our rankings of documents on words, if $p_d$ is the representation of a document in the given vector space as a point then we can think of the dot product between the hyper-plane and the document vector $H_w \cdot p_d$ as the ranking $r_dw$ of the document $d$ for the word $w$, and in particular, we take $r_d1 < r_d2$ to mean that $d_2$ has the property labelled with the word $w$ to a greater extent than $e_1$. Below, we show some examples of features and documents ranked on them for different domains. %Graphical representation of entities being ranked on a direction vector

%\end{figure}



\subsection{Filtering Words}

With the rankings $R_r$, we could create a representation of each document $d$, composed of $w_n$ dimensions, where each dimension is a ranking of the document $d$ on that word $r_dw$. However, many of the words are not spatially important enough in the representation to result in a quality ranking - they are not salient features. In this section, we aim to filter the words that are not separable, we evaluate them using a scoring metric, and remove the words that are not sufficiently well scored. We use three different metrics:

\noindent \textbf{Classification accuracy}. Evaluating the quality in terms of the accuracy of the SVM classifier: if this classifier is sufficiently accurate, it must mean that whether word $w$ relates to document $d$ (i.e.\ whether it is used in the description of $d$) is important enough to affect the semantic space representation of $d$. In such a case, it seems reasonable to assume that $w$ describes a salient property for the given domain.%This is basically copy pasted.
\smallskip

\noindent \textbf{Cohen's Kappa}. One-kind of feature we find in these domains are binary labels of documents, for example a movie either is or isn't a movie with "Gore". We can expect that the more salient a binary feature, the more linearly separable it will be in the space. One problem with accuracy as a scoring function is that these classification problems are often very imbalanced. In particular, for very rare words, a high accuracy might not necessarily imply that the corresponding direction is accurate. For this reason, \cite{Derrac2015} proposed to use Cohen's Kappa score instead. In our experiments, however, we found that accuracy sometimes yields better results, so we retain Kappa as an alternative metric. %This is basically copy pasted.
\smallskip

\noindent \textbf{Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain} % MATHEMATICS NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN
This is a standard metric in information retrieval which evaluates the quality of a ranking w.r.t.\ some given relevance scores \cite{jarvelin2002cumulated}.  In our case, the rankings $r_d$ of the document $d$ are those induced by the dot products $v_w \cdot d$ and the relevance scores are determined by the Pointwise Positive Mutual Information (PPMI) score $\textit{ppmi}(w,d)$, of the word $w$ in the BoW representation of entity $d$ where
$\textit{ppmi}(w,d) = \max \big(0, \log\big(\frac{p_{wd}}{p_{w*} \cdotp p_{*d}}\big)\big)$, and
\begin{align*}
p_{wd} &= \frac{n(w, d)}{\sum_{w'} \sum_{d'} n(w', d')}
\end{align*}
where $n(w,d)$ is the number of occurrences of $w$ in the BoW representation of object $d$, $p_{w*} = \sum_{e'} p_{wd'}$ and $p_{*d} = \sum_{w'} p_{w'd}$. %This is basically copy pasted.
\smallskip

By scoring the words on these features, we can apply a simple cut-off (e.g. the top 2000 scored words) to obtain the most salient words. Ideally, this cut-off would be at the point where the words stop corresponding to salient features. However, it is difficult to determine this. In principle, we may expect that accuracy and Kappa are best suited for binary features, as they rely on a hard separation in the space between objects that have the word in their BoW representation and those that do not, while NDCG should be better suited for gradual features. In practice, however, we could not find such a clear pattern in the differences between the words chosen by these metrics despite often finding different words. In Table \ref{Table4}, we show examples of the differences between the largest differences between the scoring methods. % Copy pasted


\subsubsection{Clustering Direction Vectors}

%What are we doing with clustering
If we consider two directions, "Blood" and "Gore", we can understand both of these to be approximating a similar feature of movies, as they both relate to how much blood a movie contains. Because of this, we can expect their directions to be very similar to each other. This is the first idea behind clustering these directions, if we average these directions together we can obtain a direction inbetween them that is a balance between documents that used the word 'Bloody' to describe the blood and the word 'Gore'. To expand on this, some entities would have the property of being bloody films, but did not necessarily use the term gore in their reviews, same as some entities having the property but using the term gore not bloody, we can understand that this new hyper plane and associated direction more accurately represents the property of a bloody film more than either of the terms individually. By extending this to a clustering method, we can find similar abstract features by ensuring that all similar directions are clustered together. %Similarly, obtaining a hyper plane using a Logistic Regression classifier that uses occurences of both and either of these terms as positive would be similar to this averaged direction.

%What is the value of a cluster label?
The word direction for "beautiful" can be nebulous to the interpreter, as it is not clear what it means for a movie to be ranked highly on 'beautiful'. Considering this, clustering provides another advantage, once we cluster the terms to find the property ("beautiful", "cinematography" "shots") we are given context for the word and more easily intuit the feature, in this case it is a feature about how well the movie was directed. 

%The final benefit to clustering the words is that linear classifiers are generally suited better to 'disentangled' representations \cite{Bengio2012}. In this case, we refer to disentanglement in the sense of obtaining a feature vector where each dimension is distinct, rather than the semantic space being naturally clustered. Additionally, if our representation is dense and disentangled into the natural features of the domain, it is unlikely to overfit and will be able to generalize more easily. 

We approach clustering the directions with a variety of methods:

\noindent \textbf{K-Means} K-Means is a clustering algorithm that starts with determining the amount of clusters, $K$. To begin, $K$ centroids $c$ are randomly placed into the space. Then, the distance between each point $p$ and centroid $c$ (in our case, points are determined by rankings) is calculated. Each point $p$ is then assigned to its closest centroid $c$. Then, the centroids are recomputed to be the mean of their assigned points. This process starting with the distance calculation is repeated until the points assigned to the centroids do not change. 

\noindent \textbf{Derrac's K-Means Variation} This is the clustering method used in the previous work \cite{derracAIJ}. As input to the clustering algorithm, we consider the $N$ best-scoring candidate feature directions $v_w$, where $N$ is a hyperparameter. The main idea underlying their approach is to select the cluster centers such that (i) they are among the top-scoring candidate feature directions, and (ii) are as close to being orthogonal to each other as possible. 
 
The output of this step is a set of clusters $C_1,...,C_K$, where we will identify each cluster $C_j$ with a set of words.
We will furthermore write $v_{C_j}$ to denote the centroid of the directions corresponding to the words in the cluster $C_j$, which can be computed as $v_{C_j}= \frac{1}{|C_j|} \sum_{w_l\in C_j} v_l$ provided that the vectors $v_w$ are all normalized. These centroids $v_{C_1},...,v_{C_k}$ are the feature directions that are identified by our method. 

We choose our first cluster centroid by taking the top-scoring direction for its associated metric. Then, we select centroids until we have reached the desired amount by taking the maximum of the summed absolute cosine similarity of all current centroids, in other words taking the most dissimilar direction to all of the current directions. Once we have selected the centroids, for each remaining direction we find the centroid it is most similar to, and the centroid is updated once the direction has been added. 


%Although we are able to find the words that are most salient, the properties in the domain may not correspond directly to words. Further, the properties may not be well described by their associated word. In-order to find better representations of properties, we cluster together similar vectors $v_w$, following the assumption that those vectors which are similar are representing some property more general than their individual words, and we can find it between them.
%As the final step, we cluster the best-scoring candidate feature directions $v_w$. Each of these clusters will then define one of the feature directions to be used in applications. The purpose of this clustering step is three-fold: it will ensure that the feature directions are sufficiently different (e.g.\ in a space of movies there is little point in having \emph{funny} and \emph{hilarious} as separate features), it will make the features easier to interpret (as a cluster of terms is more descriptive than an individual term), and it will alleviate sparsity issues when we want to relate features with the BoW representation, which will play an important role for the fine-tuning method described in the next section.


%Table \ref{tabKappaNDCG} displays some examples of clusters that have been obtained for three of the datasets that will be used in the experiments, modelling respectively movies, place-types and newsgroup postings. For each dataset, we used the scoring function that led to the best performance on development data(see Section \ref{secExperiments}). Only the first four words whose direction is closest to the centroid $v_C$ are shown.

%Our overall aim is to find directions in the semantic space that model salient features of the considered domain. For example, given a semantic space of movies, we would like to find a direction that models the extent to which each movie is scary, among others. Such a direction would then allow us to rank movies from the least scary to the most scary. We will refer to such directions as \emph{feature directions}. Formally, each feature direction will be modelled as a vector $v_f$. However, we refer to \emph{directions} rather than \emph{vectors} to emphasize their intended ordinal meaning: feature directions are aimed at ranking objects rather than e.g.\ measuring degrees of similarity. 
\section{Quantitative Results}


\subsection{Datasets}\label{ch3:datasets}

We use five different domains:

Newsgroups, originally containing 18,846 documents, is preprocessed using sklearn to remove headers, footers and quotes. Then, empty and duplicate documents are removed, resulting in 18302 documents. The vocabulary size is 141,321. The data is not shuffled. After filtering out terms that did not occur in at least two documents, we ended up with a vocabulary of size 51,064. 

Sentiment is dataset where documents are reviews, containing 50,000 documents with a vocabulary size of 78588. After removing terms that did not occur in at least two documents, we ended up with a vocab of size 55384. Notably, this means that we removed all terms that did not occur in two documents for the sentiment, and in two documents for the newsgroups, and newsgroups began with a larger vocabulary than sentiment, but the ending vocabularies were about the same. This means that the terms in the newsgroups were more sparse than sentiment. In other words, newsgroups contained many terms that were not relevant to a majority of the documents. This is unsurprising, as it is a collection of 20 different newsgroups, rather than one single domain.

Reuters is a dataset of reuters news wires, originally containing 10788 documents. After removing empty and duplicate documents, we end-up with 10655 documents. It originally contained 90 classes, but as they were extremely unbalanced we removed all classes that did not have at least 100 positive instances, resulting in 21 classes. All other classes in other domains meet this threshold. The original vocabulary size is 51,0001, and after removing all words that do not occur in at least two documents, the vocabulary size is 22542. 

Placetypes is a data-set of flickr tags, taken from the previous work \cite{Derrac2015}. It originally has a vocabulary size of 746,527 and 1383 documents. This is a very large vocabulary size to document ratio. The end vocabulary for this space was 100,000, which we used as a hard limit. This is roughly equivalent to removing all documents that would not be in at least 6 documents.

Movies is a dataset where each document is a movie represented by all of its reviews concatenated across a number of sources. It starts off with a vocabulary size of 551,080 and a document size of 15,000. However, after investigating the data made available by the authors, we found that there were a number of duplicate documents. After removing these duplicate documents, we end-up with 13978 documents. In the same way as the movies, we limit the vocabulary size at 100,000.

For all of these datasets, we split them into a 2/3 training data, 1/3 test data split. We additionally remove the end 20\% of the training data and use that as development data for our hyper-parameters, which is then not used for the final models verified using test data.

\subsection{Evaluation Method}

We primarily examine the effectiveness of a representation on its ability to perform in low-depth Decision Trees, specifically CART Decision Trees (See Background Section \ref{bg:trees}) with a limited depth of one, two and three. We enter this evaluation with a few assumptions: A good interpretable representation disentangles salient domain knowledge into its dimensions, and natural domain tasks (e.g. classifying genres of movies using their reviews) can be evaluated effectively using that salient domain knowledge. Put another way, if the space is representing domain knowledge well we can expect that the space is linearly separable for key semantics of the domain. In spatial terms, a representation will be capable of being linearly transformed by our method into these distinct relevant concepts if semantically distinct entities are spatially separated, and semantically similar entities are close together. 

If we only wanted to evaluate the quality of the representation, we could use Linear SVM's to find the hyper-planes that effectively separate these spatial representations for the class. However, the representations that encode this spatial information are not interpretable, so a linear classifier although able to separate the documents that contain the class and do not contain them will not be interpretable either. It is our main interest to evaluate how well a representation encodes these key semantics while also being restricted by the requirement to be disentangled into words or clusters, in other words how well it represents the information while also being interpretable.

Given these assumptions, low-depth decision trees can give an estimation of how good an interpretable representation is. If the representation cannot perform for a class at a one-depth tree, then it is not disentangled such that it contains a single salient dimension that effectively evaluates a class. If a representation cannot perform well on two-depth trees, then the representation is not disentangled into three concepts that can sufficiently determine that class, and if a representation cannot perform well on three-depth trees, it has not disentangled the representation such that there are nine relevant concepts that are relevant to that class. To see what these different trees look like see figure \ref{IntroDecisionTree}. A comparison to put this in better perspective is to an unbounded tree. Unbounded trees select a large amount of dimensions in order to achieve a performance difference on development data, but when applied to test data the models do not generalize well. This is because they overfit, rather than using the key semantics of the space to classify.

We look primarily at the F1-score to determine if a classifier is good or not. This is because many of the classes are unbalanced (See above in Section \ref{ch3:datasets} for exactly how unbalanced) so accuracy is not a good metric, as high accuracy could be achieved by predicting only zeros.  All of the results shown in this section are the end-product of a two-part hyper-parameter optimization. Each Decision Tree has its own set of hyper-parameters that are optimized as does each representation-type. These are the models trained on the training data and scored on the test data, with the highest performing in terms of F1-score parameters from hyper-parameter optimization on the development data. For ease of comparison, we provide some results with SVM's and unbounded Decision Trees, as well as a baseline Topic Model, which we use as a reference for a standard interpretable representation. Below, we list the parameters that we optimize for each of these model types:

\textbf{Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM's)}: %C parameters and gamma parameters. C 1.0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, Gamma 1.0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001.
\textbf{Topic Models}:% doc_topic_prior (0.001, 0.01, 0.1), topic_word_prior = (0.001, 0.01, 0.1)
\textbf{CART Decision Trees }: %The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. (None, auto, log2), criterion: (gini, entropy)
	
%For our baselines, we use four different semantic spaces, a bag-of-words of PPMI (BOW-PPMI) scores and a standard Latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Model. As well as the original filtering done to the representations, for the BOW-PPMI we additionally filter out all terms that do not occur in at least (doc_size / 1000) documents. Otherwise, there would be too many irrelevant terms to be a fair comparison. We compare different dimension amounts of size (50, 100, 200). Below we explain our choices for the semantic spaces that are formally described in Section \ref{bg:SemanticSpaces}:

\textbf{Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)}: %A non-linear transformation that we can use to evaluate the quality of representations when built from a standard BOW-PPMI. Performed well in previous papers.
\textbf{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}: %A standard dimensionality reduction technique. 
\textbf{Doc2Vec (D2V)}: %For the Doc2Vec space, we additionally tune hyper-parameters for the window_size (5, 10, 15), the min_count (1, 5, 10) and the epochs (50, 100, 200) for each size space. The process with our two-part hyperparameter optimization as in this case is as follows: We use grid search to select the parameters for the representation, then find the most suitable model (e.g. Decision Tree, SVM) for that representation. 
\textbf{Average Word Vectors (AWV)}: %A simple representation that we can use to evaluate the ability of word-vectors to correctly represent domain concepts when averaged.

When obtaining the single word directions, we take all of the baseline representations and vocabularies, and filter the vocabularies according to a hyper-parameter that we tune. As the doc2vec has already been hyper-parameter optimized, we use the optimal doc2vec space that scored the highest for its class on a Linear SVM, rather than tuning the entire process around the doc2vecs vectors. So for example, when we are evaluating the Keywords task for the movies, we would obtain directions from the doc2vec space that performed best for a linear SVM on the Keywords task following the previous experiments. 

The parameters were 
%We use the kind of multiclass strategy as a hyper-parameter for each class-type in the grid search. We test the OneVsOne classifier method, treating each as binary problems, the OneVsRest method and the OutputCode method.
We are not able to obtain an MDS space for sentiment or doc2vec spaces for placetypes/movies.

For example, a good vector space in the domain of movies constructed from IMDB movie reviews should contain a natural separation of entities into genres, where Horror movies are spatially distant from Romance movies, and movies that are Romantic Horrors would be somewhere inbetween. We can see an example in Figure \ref{figure:genres_separated}. For a Bag-Of-Words, we can expect similar entities to have similarly scoring terms \ref{PPMI table:PPMI_example}.

We obtain results for the rankings induced from these word directions on Decision Tree's limited to a depth of 3 in-order to select the best parameters when using directions for each class. The parameters that we want to determine are the type of Semantic Space, the size of the space, the frequency threshold and the score threshold. To do so, for each space-type of each size, we use a grid search to find the best frequency and score cut-offs for that sized space-type. Then, we select from these space-types and sizes the best performing one. We can understand there to be a balance between finding words which are useful for creating salient features in our clustering step without including too many words which do not. As our clustering methods are unsupervised, it is important that we try and limit the amount of junk being entered into them, despite the classifiers that use these directions typically being able to filter out those directions which are not suitable to the class. Additionally, as the vocabulary size varies from dataset to dataset, the threshold will naturally be different for each one. 

These results allow us to choose for each class, the best Semantic Space and Scoring-type for that class.
Next, we test single directions, attempting to find a good amount of directions to cluster and not including words which may hamper the unsupervised classification, as well as the best space-type for each domain. We found that generally, X was the best space and as expected classifiers performed better with more data, so we use 20000 as our frequency cutoff and 2000 as our score cutoff. 

We continue with the optimal space and score-type chosen by our single direction experiments, and use the same frequency and score thresholds as before. We then experiment with two different clustering algorithms: Derrac and K-Means. As these algorithms select centroids from the top-scoring directions or randomly, we can expect that some clusters may not be salient features of the space. This is because top-scoring directions, e.g. for accuracy could simply infrequent terms that do not have much meaning, and these infrequehnt terms could also be randomly selected. We could use grid-search on the frequency and score cutoffs when obtaining these results in order to avoid terms that may disrupt existing clusters or form cluster centers that are not salient features of the space, but we chose a more standardized process that would rely on the parameters of the clustering algorithms and the ability of the classifiers to filter out clusters that are not informative, so as to not make a time-costly grid search a necessary part of the process.

With that in mind, we use three clustering algorithms.

Mini batch K-means, implemented by scikit-learn \footnote{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.MiniBatchKMeans.html}, introduced by \cite{Sculley2010} and kmeans++ to initialize \cite{Arthur}

To begin, we compare the original dimensions of the space, the rankings on single words, the rankings on cluster directions, a bag-of-words of PPMI scores and

\subsection{Baseline Representations}

To begin, we show in Table \ref{ch3:ng} all variations of the baseline representations used directly as input to Decision Trees and SVM's. These examples that do not apply our methodology, serve as a reference point for what is possible using standard linear models without the need for interpretability. There is a big performance drop when going from depth three trees to depth one trees. These kind of performance drops are expected for these representations, as they do not have dimensions that correspond to key semantics, so it is unlikely that a smaller tree will be able to use the available dimensions to classify well. In this full table we include the precision and recall scores for clarity, mainly to explain why the high recall scores occur. This is because we balanced the weights as one of our hyper-parameters, and when the weight is balanced so that positive instances are weighted more heavily, the model prioritizes recall over precision. When this high recall score doesn't occur, that means that not balancing the weights performed better on the development data.

The size of the space is not as influential as the representation type in these results for the Decision Trees. For this reason we show only the best performing representation of each type in the main results table for this section. Although Linear SVM's perform the best on these representations without the need for interpretability, future results will be for low-depth decision trees in-order to easily distinguish the degree to which key semantics correspond to dimensions in the representations.

\subsection{Semantic Spaces}
In this section, we explain how we obtained four different Semantic Spaces. \label{ch3:Method}
% Basic explanation of why quantitative results are interesting, valuable, good etc






\subsection{Word Directions}

 For all trees we use grid search to find the best values for the criterion, either the gini score or the information entropy score, the maximum amount of features between [None, 'auto', 'log2'], and additionally, we include whether or not to balance the classes in the grid search.

%What is the importance of the space size?
%What is the importance of the space type?
%How do directions perform compared to spaces? Why?
%What kind of directions do we find for each score type?
%Why does the score type matter? What score type works best?

These single directions typically overfit.

\section{Qualitative Results}


Make reference to the qualitative results found in the previous work here.


\subsection{Examining the differences between directions}

Investigating three potential hypothesis:
1. The ranks are more accurate, so the key directions are better represented that would contribute
2. The spaces/score-types contain unique directions that contribute to the tree directly
3. The spaces/score-types influence the rankings so that they are better represented, but are not directly used in the tree

First, we look at the best scoring directions. Then, we look at the unique directions for each space-type and score-type. The section is then followed by conclusions, and we begin to look into the clusters.

\subsection{The best-performing directions for each space type}

What are the domains that best convey the similarities and differences between different domains?

1. Find domains that act differently (perhaps one domain where a space-type that is not usually scoring high is scoring high, big differences in F1)
2. Get interesting directions from those domains

\subsection{How Domain Directions Differ}

For the single directions, arrange them by score where the highest scoring directions are at the top. For the clusters, there is no convenient way to organize them without bias, so clusters that are interesting are selected.

\subsubsection{Score Types}

There are unique directions for each different space type, each suitable to different tasks. NDCG was selected as the best score-type for Sentiment, Newsgroups, Reuters, Movies Genres, Movies Keywords in depth-3 Decision Trees. Place-types foursquare used F1-score, but the classes are very unbalanced and there are few documents.

\subsubsection{Comparing Space Types}

We begin by selecting the space that performed well on the genres task for the movies, with the understanding that genres as a key natural classification task will likely make use of good directions that correspond to domain knowledge. After selecting this space, we choose similarly sized spaces from the other space-types, in this case we selected the 200 dimensional MDS space as it performed the best and from there, we selected the 200 dimensional PCA space and AWV space. We also use the same score-type and frequency cut-off as the best performing space-type. In this case, the best performing type for the PCA space was 20000 frequency cutoff and NDCG, and we are comparing to 10000 frequency cutoff. This means that we are sometimes using a slightly worse performing space-type than the one we used as our final results, and that the original space has a performance advantage, but we have chosen to do so to make the results more consistent and specific. We approach these qualitative experiments with the following idea: spaces that perform better on natural domain tasks using decision trees contain unique natural directions that other spaces do not have. 

The commonalities between spaces are much more prevalent than the differences, with natural concepts of the domain being represented in all of the different space types. However, different spaces do perform better than others on natural domain tasks. In this section, we investigate why this occurs and the differences between spaces built using a standard frequency-based approach, word-vectors and doc2vec, which uses a combination of contextual information and word vectors.

%We show terms unique to each domain type above. The terms are contextualized by finding the two closest term directions to the term. Here, we show the terms that are not duplicated in meaning for the other spaces. We can understand that the term 'gay (gays, homosexuality) has a similar meaning to the term 'homosexuality (gays, gay)' despite the term 'homosexuality' being high scored for one space, and the term 'gay' being highly scored for the other space. Almost all of the unique terms were of this variety. To demonstrate instead the unique meanings found in the individual spaces, we filter the results as follows: from the term and its associated descriptive terms found by getting the most similar terms, if those terms or any of the more similar terms occur in any of the terms or more similar terms in the space's top 1000 terms that we are comparing to, do not include those terms.

%We find that the 50-dimensional MDS space, which performs 0.04 F1 score higher on the genres task, finds many interesting and unique terms, which can potentially enable more nuanced decisions in the decision trees for classification. On the other hand, in the PCA space, we find terms that relate to metadata, and spanish language words. We argue that this means the MDS is better at finding unique interesting meanings than PCA, in the case of using a frequency-based BOW to create the representation.

%We perform the same process as above but comparing MDS and AWV, and find that the PPMI-based representations have their own metadata in the representation that is elevated. We can assume that the AWV space does not contain these metadata as there are simply not word-vectors available for these terms. Although, we also find unique terms that are likely to help performance on natural domain tasks for the MDS space, e.g. goodfellas, disgusting, swashbuckling. Interestingly, for the AWV space we find similar spanish-language terms, but also find some new concepts, in particular the 'republican' and 'yoga' directions. AWV was also originally 20,000 frequency and NDCG.

%The previous two experiments were conducted with the IMDB movies dataset, but the doc2vec space is not available for that dataset, as the original text corpus was not made available by the authors. Because of this, we choose to compare the PCA representation for the sentiment space and the Doc2Vec representation for the sentiment space, as these are still IMDB movie reviews, but instead with reviews as documents rather than compilations of reviews as documents, we can expect different directions to be important but still use our knowledge of movies and reviews to inform us. We take the 100 dimensional D2V space and the 100 dimensional PCA space, both of which perform best using the ndcg scoring type which we do not change.

%The assumption going into this analysis was that, in the same way that the AWV space does not contain metadata that is not present in the word-vectors, as will the Doc2Vec space not be informed especially by that metadata. Further, as in this case the D2V space outperforms the PCA space on the sentiment task, we also expect that by using word-context to produce the representation, we are able to find better sentiment information directions, for example by better understanding sarcasm. Additionally, the benefit of word-vectors is likely to play into this space in a positive way, informing the representation based on global context. 

%When looking at these directions, we can split the terms into two types. The names of things, and conceptual properties about movies. For the doc2vec space, the names largely dominate the unique terms list, which we can understand to mean that these terms used contextually and in the broader global context from the word-vectors is informative enough in the doc2vec space to be usefully represented. For the PCA space, there are still these unique names found, but there are less overall terms and it's a bit more balanced between concepts and names. 

%For some additional examples, we compare the MDS representation for the newsgroups and the Doc2Vec representation. The MDS performed best with F1, but we compare it to NDCG, as that is what the doc2vec space performs best with.


\subsection{What is the value of different score-types?}

\subsection{Producing Semantic Spaces}

We use unsupervised representation learning methods, with the intention to obtain a representation that represents all salient features of the domain and can adapt to a variety of tasks. 

For the semantic space, we compute the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (See \ref{bg:PPMI}) scores for the Bag-Of-Words, and use that as input to a variety of different off-the-shelf dimensionality reduction algorithms. We explain these in further detail in Section \ref{ch3:Spaces}. 


\subsection{Quantitative Results}
From a domain, e.g. movie reviews, where each document is a collection of reviews for a movie, we preprocess the text such that it is converted to lower-case, and non-alphanumeric characters are removed. From here, we remove standard English stop words using the NLTK library \cite{Bird}. We show an example of a review's original and converted formats in Figure \ref{ch3:OrigAndConverted}. From this preprocessed corpus, we obtain a Bag-Of-Words where we count the frequency of each term $BOW_wf$, see \ref{background:BOW}. 

The difference between single directions and clusters is best highlighted when comparing their use in simple interpretable classifiers. In figure \ref{ch3:ComparedTrees} we demonstrate this.

1. Negative directions (e.g. church for horror)
2. Non-contextualized, non-direct ways of classifying, versus clustering which finds salient properties which almost directly correspond to these natural tasks.
